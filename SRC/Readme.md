# Algorithm-Tutorial

## Overview

**Algorithm-Tutorial** is a simple project designed to introduce and demonstrate basic algorithms in C++. This project includes examples of common algorithms like sorting, searching, and data manipulation, with detailed explanations and code to help beginners understand how algorithms work in practice.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

Algorithm-Tutorial/ 
├── src/ │
          └── algorithm_example.c++ # Main code demonstrating basic algorithms 
├── README.md # This file 
└── Instructions.md 


- The `src/` folder contains the main C++ code file (`algorithm_example.cpp`), which demonstrates a simple algorithm.
- The `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary files, such as build artifacts or IDE-specific files, are not pushed to the repository.

## Features

- A basic demonstration of an algorithm (e.g., sorting) in C++.
- Easy to follow and modify for beginners who want to learn algorithm implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler**: You can use GCC, Clang, or any C++ compiler.
- **IDE/Text Editor**: You can use Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any code editor of your choice.

## How to Compile and Run

Follow these steps to compile and run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Algorithm-Tutorial.git
   cd Algorithm-Tutorial
